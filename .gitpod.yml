## The 'tasks' section defines how Gitpod prepares and builds this project
## or how Gitpod can start development servers. With Gitpod, there are three
## types of tasks:
##
## - before: Use this for tasks that need to run before init and before command. 
## - init: Use this to configure prebuilds of heavy-lifting tasks such as
##         downloading dependencies or compiling source code.
## - command: Use this to start your database or application when the workspace starts.
##
## Learn more about these tasks at 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-start-tasks'
